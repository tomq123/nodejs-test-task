I used https://github.com/sanjaytwisk/nextjs-ts to get started quickly

## Getting started

Before you can start developing your awesome application you need to install the project's dependencies. Make sure you have Node and NPM installed and run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

### ‚å®Ô∏è Development

Once all dependencies have been installed you can start development. To start a development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) run:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

### üñ• Production

To run your application in production make sure to run a build first:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

And then start you application with a provided port number (defaults to 3000 if not provided):

```sh
$ PORT=8080 npm run start
```

### üñ® Static

You can export your application to a static website as well:

```sh
npm run export
```

This will render static HTML pages into `./out`
